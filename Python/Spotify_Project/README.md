# Spotify Song Popularity Analysis

This mini-project explores which musical features influence a song’s popularity on Spotify.

## Overview

The analysis investigates how audio characteristics such as _energy_, _danceability_, and _valence_ relate to a track’s popularity score.
A full data science workflow is applied — from data exploration to model building and evaluation.

## Workflow

1. **Data exploration** using `pandas` and `seaborn`
2. **Correlation analysis** and visualization of feature relationships
3. **Predictive modeling** using Linear Regression
4. **Evaluation** with R² and Mean Absolute Error

## Results

- Features like **danceability** and **energy** show the strongest positive associations with popularity.
- **Acousticness** has a negative correlation, indicating acoustic songs tend to be less popular.
- The model explains ~1% of variance, suggesting external factors (e.g., artist fame, marketing) play a larger role.
