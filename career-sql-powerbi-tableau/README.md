# Career Development Plan – SQL, Power BI & Tableau

This repository tracks my learning journey across three core tools in Data Science as part of my MSc in Data Science at the University of Skövde.

## Goals

- **SQL:** Master joins, subqueries, and window functions.
- **Power BI:** Build an interactive Business Performance Dashboard using DAX and data modeling.
- **Tableau:** Create a visual storytelling dashboard (EU Employment Story).

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to one tool:

- `/SQL` → scripts, examples, and exercises
- `/PowerBI` → dashboard files and DAX experiments
- `/Tableau` → stories and visualizations
