# Data Science Portfolio

My learning journey in Data Science, applying Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau alongside AI methods to transform data into insight, structure, and meaningful results.  

Each folder represents one key skill area in my Data Science toolkit and includes projects, analyses, and reflections that demonstrate both technical development and applied understanding.

## Structure

**Python** – Exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and applied projects using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.  
**SQL** – Query design, joins, subqueries, and performance-focused data extraction.  
**Power BI** – Interactive dashboards, DAX formulas, and data modeling for business analytics.  
**Tableau** – Data storytelling and visual analysis through dynamic dashboards.  
**Projects** – Larger applied works integrating multiple tools in end-to-end workflows.
