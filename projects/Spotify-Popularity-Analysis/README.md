# ðŸŽµ What Makes a Song Popular? â€“ Spotify Data Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project explores which musical features make a song popular using the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset).
The dataset contains ~100k songs with features such as danceability, energy, tempo, valence (mood), and popularity.

## ðŸ§  Research Question

> Which characteristics are most strongly associated with a songâ€™s popularity?

## ðŸ§© Methods and Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Visualization (matplotlib / seaborn)
3. (Optional) Modeling: Linear Regression or Decision Tree
4. Evaluation & reflections (over/underfitting, limitations)

## ðŸ§° Tools

Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Seaborn â€¢ Scikit-learn â€¢ Jupyter

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Visuals

Energy vs Popularity â€¢ Valence vs Popularity â€¢ Correlation heatmap

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections

Goal: practice the full DS process (question â†’ data â†’ method â†’ results â†’ reflection), not a perfect model.
